# AOIA-Core

AOIA-Core is one local-first runtime for AI-assisted engineering and evidence-aware review. It keeps model output, tool results, evidence, provenance, contradictions, runtime state, and human authority separate instead of treating them as interchangeable forms of truth.

AOIA means **Adaptive Oceanic Intelligence Architecture**. In this repository the name describes a bounded routing and control architecture; it does not imply AGI, autonomous authority, or a self-modifying system.

## What is implemented

- deterministic local routing before provider use
- optional external model providers behind one `ProviderManager`
- structured shell, filesystem, browser, and project-inspection actions
- explicit operator approval for non-response actions
- local Linux/RHCSA retrieval with provenance and refusal boundaries
- append-only provenance support and contradiction tracking
- local CLI, web console, and optional Textual TUI over the same runtime
- deterministic dated-evidence review with source hashes and a mandatory human-review result

The dated-evidence capability is a module of AOIA-Core, not a second application. Its CLI command, JSON endpoints, browser workbench, tests, and documentation all live in this repository and use the same launch surface.

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.11 or newer. The deterministic evidence-review path uses only the Python standard library and needs no API key.

Run the terminal interface:

```bash
./runtime/run.sh
```

Run the unified local web console:

```bash
./runtime/run_web.sh
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:4311>. The server accepts loopback bindings only. The **Assistant** and **Evidence review** views are modules of the same AOIA-Core process.

Install optional provider/browser dependencies into a local virtual environment:

```bash
./runtime/install.sh
```

The optional Textual interface starts with:

```bash
./scripts/start_tui.sh
```

## Dated evidence review

The bundled scenario demonstrates a common high-stakes failure: a fluent answer repeats Germany's 2025 statutory minimum-wage value for a July 2026 question. AOIA-Core compares the answer with three dated official records, identifies stale or conflicting values, checks temporal/source attribution, and hashes both the evidence set and answer snapshot.

Run the bundled stale example in the CLI:

```text
/review
```

Run the corrected example or supply your own candidate text:

```text
/review corrected
/review Seit Januar 2026 gelten laut BMAS 13,90 Euro brutto je Zeitstunde.
```

The web API exposes the same engine:

```text
GET  /api/review/scenario
POST /api/review
```

Example request:

```json
{
  "candidate_answer": "Der Mindestlohn beträgt 12,82 Euro brutto pro Stunde."
}
```

Every successful comparison retains these authority boundaries:

```json
{
  "decision_state": "HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED",
  "authority": "METADATA_ONLY_NO_AUTHORITY",
  "legal_advice": false,
  "network_used": false
}
```

The module is intentionally bounded. A matching number corroborates one registry value; it does not prove that an entire answer is correct, decide whether a rule applies to a person, or replace current official sources or qualified advice. The bundled records were rechecked on 2026-08-25 against [BMAS guidance](https://www.bmas.de/DE/Arbeit/Arbeitsrecht/Mindestlohn/Informationen-zum-Mindestlohn/informationen-zum-mindestlohn-deutsch.html), the [official rate history](https://www.bmas.de/DE/Arbeit/Arbeitsrecht/Mindestlohn/Glossar/G/Gesetzlicher-Mindestlohn.html), and [MiLoV5](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/milov5/MiLoV5.pdf).

See [Dated Evidence Review](docs/modules/DATED_EVIDENCE_REVIEW.md) for the contract and extension rules.

## Runtime flow

```text
Operator
  ├─ /review or evidence-review UI
  │    -> bounded input validation
  │    -> immutable dated registry
  │    -> deterministic comparison + SHA-256
  │    -> HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED
  │
  └─ normal request
       -> slash commands / local router
       -> epistemic and knowledge gates
       -> optional provider planning
       -> structured action validation
       -> operator approval when required
       -> local executor
       -> result, state, and provenance boundaries
```

External providers are optional and non-deterministic. Their output may assist an operator, but it is not evidence, provenance, or runtime authority by default. The evidence-review module never calls a provider.

## Useful commands

```text
/status
/model
/model gemini
/providers
/setup
/review
/hat list
/scan /path/to/project
/rhcsa status
/tools
/help
```

`/model` changes the assistant provider/model selection. It does not change the deterministic review engine or its authority state.

## Provider configuration

Provider credentials must remain outside the repository. Depending on the selected provider, AOIA-Core can read environment variables such as:

- `AUREON_API_BASE_URL` and `AUREON_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `XAI_API_KEY`
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`

Use `/setup` for the local configuration checklist and `/providers` for availability. Never commit keys, browser profiles, session logs, or machine-specific state.

```

Mutable runtime state is stored outside the checkout under `~/.local/state/aoia` by default. Set `AOIA_HOME` to use another local state root.

## Safety and authority

AOIA-Core is designed around explicit boundaries:

- risky local actions require operator confirmation where gates are implemented
- model output cannot silently become evidence
- provenance verifies recorded lineage/integrity, not factual truth
- unresolved local retrieval can refuse instead of fabricating an answer
- evidence review is read-only, deterministic, size-bounded, and human-gated
- the local web server rejects non-loopback bindings and applies restrictive browser headers

AOIA-Core is not a truth engine, legal adviser, generic autonomous agent, production security certification, or scientific validation system.

## Tests

Run the complete suite from the repository root:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=runtime PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
  python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The suite covers routing determinism, execution containment, evidence/provenance contracts, retrieval refusal, provider selection, CLI commands, the dated-evidence engine, its static no-provider/no-write boundaries, and the integrated local web API. Browser and TUI tests skip cleanly when their optional dependencies are not installed.
