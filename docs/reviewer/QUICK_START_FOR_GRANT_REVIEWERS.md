# Quick Start for Grant Reviewers

## 1. What AOIA-Core is

AOIA-Core is a local-first deterministic and rule-based runtime prototype for
AI-assisted technical workflows. It focuses on provenance, evidence boundaries,
contradiction tracking, controlled retrieval, and human operator approval for
risky actions.

## 2. What AOIA-Core is not

AOIA-Core is not:

- AGI
- an autonomous production agent
- a truth engine
- a scientific validation system
- an LSC or neutrino validation project
- a GUI, mobile, or frontend product

## 3. What to inspect first

Start with:

- `docs/governance/IMPLEMENTED_CAPABILITIES.md`
- `docs/reviewer/PROJECT_OVERVIEW_FOR_REVIEWERS.md`
- `docs/reviewer/ONE_CONCRETE_EXAMPLE.md`
- `docs/nms/GLOSSARY.md`
- `docs/nms/ROADMAP_4_MONTHS.md`

Then inspect representative runtime files:

- `runtime/tools/provenance.py`
- `runtime/retrieval/facade.py`

## 4. How to run validation

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m compileall runtime tests
PYTHONPATH=runtime:. python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py" -v
```

## 5. Expected validation result

`compileall` is syntax validation only. It does not prove runtime correctness,
security, scientific validity, or production readiness.

The known current savepoint result is:

- `145` tests run
- `4` optional UI/Textual tests skipped
- `OK`

## 6. Capability evidence map

Use `docs/governance/IMPLEMENTED_CAPABILITIES.md` as the conservative capability
map. It separates implemented, partial, planned, and documentation-only claims.
Do not infer production readiness from documentation presence alone.

## 7. Scope warnings

LSC appears only as a historical research origin and high-claim-density neutrino
archive stress-test corpus. It is not validated physics, not AOIA-Core
scientific output, and not runtime authority.

SCEMDA, HNC, Gary-related, and other external collaborator material remain
external and non-canonical unless explicitly promoted through governed
human-approved processes.

## 8. Recommended reading order

1. `docs/reviewer/QUICK_START_FOR_GRANT_REVIEWERS.md`
2. `docs/nms/GLOSSARY.md`
3. `docs/reviewer/PROJECT_OVERVIEW_FOR_REVIEWERS.md`
4. `docs/governance/IMPLEMENTED_CAPABILITIES.md`
5. `docs/reviewer/ONE_CONCRETE_EXAMPLE.md`
6. `docs/nms/ROADMAP_4_MONTHS.md`
